# Monaco

Do you open VSCode to edit a specific file and nothing else?
Now you can edit your files with Monaco without leaving Atom.

There are three ways you can use this package:

## From an Atom's Text Editor

Right-click on one of the Atom's editors and select "To Monaco Editor"

## From file extension

In this package's configuration list the extensions you want to edit using Monaco.

eg:
> .js, .php, .html, .css

## From Tree View

Right-click on a file and select "Open with Monaco"

> Note: If you already have that file opened atom will try to reuse that editor. Use the first option instead.
